# Masters Thesis Project
I've included some of my codes that I've written for my thesis project. For example, one has photometric and radial velocity data for V392 Carinae binary system along with ELC light curve models can be plotted in panels. Another are for data processing. More descriptions will be in the given folder in the folders of this repository.
